# Project Title

R Shiny project to interactively visualize weather and climate data

## Description

RShiny project to visualize open source data published by DWD (Deutscher Wetterdienst; opendata.dwd.de). The idea is to test what is possible to produce by open source data and whether Rshiny is a suitable environment to represent weather and climate data.
A working version is online available at https://laubfrosch.shinyapps.io/weather-icond2/. However, there it is rather slow as the free version of shinyapps.io is not suitable for large datasets. A faster and more modern version can be found in the split up code of icond2, messdata, phenology and icond2_website or online at laubfrosch.balga.ch.
